I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Steve Mann who inspired me to embark on my journey in wearable computing. I still remember my first encounter with Professor Mann back in 2006. In his first lecture, he bought in many of his research equipments from his projects, and had given us a demonstration on how each of these works. Some notable projects include real-time light painting with digital camera, high dynamic range imaging, EyeTap, video orbits, and cyborglogging. Despite his popularity and busy schedule, he was very approachable, and also introduced me to the core members from the research lab. At that time, he was wearing his EyeTap eyeglasses invention, and he was showing us the possibility of creating a digital eyeglasses that allows us to see better. I could never achieve what I have today without his unique guidance and giving me such opportunity in the first place.. 

Then, I would like to thank Dr. James Fung, my mentor and also best coding partner. We have collaborated on various projects such as cyborglogging and he had provided me the first exposure to real-time computer vision processing with GPUs.

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the research we collaborated on the HDR and Digital Eye Glass project. Specifically, I would like to thank Valmiki who had brought many of my unorganized source code and thoughts into reliable executables and source code, and analyzing all errors and bugs that were in the system. I would like to thank Han Wu who designed the first generation of the digital eyeglasses with me. Without his design, the wearable computers will never be able to  , and Most importantly to me, these individuals believed in the vision and we shared the same dream. There were countless nights we all come together, and putting all efforts into a system which changes the way we see. 
 
Lastly, I would like to thank Meron who invited me to be the co-founder and co-inventor of Meta. Meta is now a company with over a hundred of employees in 2017, and we have successfully shipped two Augmented Reality Eyeglasses products to the market. This experience had bought me insight and core validation about what we had been pursuing for the last decade. He is a unique and strong person who can pushed my boundary and capability in all dimensions.

Today, I believe that we will be wearing a pair eyeglasses or alike which will redefine the way we see this world. This vision is no longer my own dream, but a collective mind from everyone in the history.
