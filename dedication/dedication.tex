I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Steve Mann who inspired me to embark on my journey in wearable computing. I still vividly remember the first day I met with Professor Mann back in 2006. In his first lecture, he bought in many of his research equipments from his prior projects, and had given us a set of real-time live demonstrations. That day he told the class that he can see beyond what human eye is possible. For example, we can observe physical phenomenas that are not visible to our bare human eye with his EyeTap, such as WiFi signal. Despite his popularity and busy schedule, he was very approachable, and he also introduced me to the core members from the research lab. At that time, he was wearing his EyeTap eyeglasses invention, and he was showing us the possibility of creating a digital eyeglasses that allows us to see better, and be able to download prescription from the internet. It is still mind blowing to be able to turn what we learn into something we can use everyday. I could never achieve what I have today without his unique guidance and giving me such opportunity in the first place.. 

I would like to thank Dr. James Fung who provided me guidance for entering the PhD program. We have collaborated on various projects such as cyborglogging and James had shown me the path in parallel programming and real-time computer vision processing with GPUs. 

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the research we collaborated on the HDR and Digital Eye Glass project. Specifically, I would like to thank Valmiki Rampersad who had bought the GPU version of the HDR project to life. For the FPGA collaboration efforts, I would like to thank Tao Ai and Kalin Ovtcharov who had made the proposed algorithm implementable on FPGA. For the wearable eyeglasses project, I would like to thank Han Wu who designed the first generation of the Digital Eye Glasses with me. Without his design, the wearable computers will never be able to take the final form. I'm grateful to have so many peopl believed in the same vision.
 
Lastly, I would like to thank my family and Prof Mann who supported me to take the time to explore my career in Meta as a co-founder, co-inventor and CTO. Meta is now a company with over a hundred of employees, and we have successfully shipped two products. This experience had bought me insight and core validation about what we had been pursuing for the last decade. In the future, I believe that we will be wearing a pair of eyeglasses which will change the way we see this world. This vision is no longer my own dream.
