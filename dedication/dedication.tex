I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Steve Mann who inspired me to embark on my journey in wearable computing. I still vividly remember the first day I met with Professor Mann back in 2006. In his first lecture, he bought in many of his research equipments from his projects, and had given us a real-time live demonstration. That day he told us that he can see radio waves, and many of the physical phenomena are not visible to our bare human eye with his EyeTap. Despite his popularity and busy schedule, he was very approachable, and also introduced me to the core members from the research lab. At that time, he was wearing his EyeTap eyeglasses invention, and he was showing us the possibility of creating a digital eyeglasses that allows us to see better. I could never achieve what I have today without his unique guidance and giving me such opportunity in the first place.. 

Then, I would like to thank Dr. James Fung, my mentor and also the first provided me the light to a PhD program. I was in my third year  We have collaborated on various projects such as cyborglogging and he had provided me the first exposure to real-time computer vision processing with GPUs.

I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the research we collaborated on the HDR and Digital Eye Glass project. Specifically, I would like to thank Valmiki Rampersad who had bought the GPU version of the HDR project to life. I would like to thank Han Wu who designed the first generation of the Digital Eye Glasses with me. Without his design, the wearable computers will never be able to take the form. I'm grateful to have all these partners who believed in the vision of creating the best tools to extend our capability. There were countless nights we all come together, and putting all efforts into a system which changes the way we see one day.
 
Lastly, I would like to thank Meron who invited me to be the co-founder and co-inventor of Meta. Meta is now a company with over a hundred of employees in 2017, and we have successfully shipped two Augmented Reality Eyeglasses products to the market. This experience had bought me insight and core validation about what we had been pursuing for the last decade. He is a unique and strong person who can pushed my boundary and capability in all dimensions.

Today, I believe that we will be wearing a pair eyeglasses or alike which will redefine the way we see this world. This vision is no longer my own dream, but a collective mind from everyone in the history.
