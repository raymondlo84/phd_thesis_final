Fundamentally, human is bandwidth limited.  the pace of ever advancing technology.  

We first address the fundamental dynamic range issues in wearable camera sensors and apparatus. 
 
In the we developed a practical implementation of high dynamic range vision system for Digital Eye Glass in both FPGAs and GPUs platform.. 
 
Secondly, we discuss the use of HDR techniques in depth sensing technology and propose ways of creating new 3D sensors for wearable applications. 
 
Lastly, we demonstrated an untethered wearable solution that with gestural input. The recognition in everyday life. the social implication in each of these scenario and how . 

This dissertation presents the fundamental issues that would contribute toward the future of `cyborgs' and superhuman intelligence that arise from the synergy of human and machine.
